# Hotel_booking_Analysis_with_python
A.There are various Online Hotel Booking Companies that provides us facilities to book hotel.
and according to a survey, it is estimated that approx 50 million bookings happened in a month.
So just try to imagine how much huge chunk of data users are creating whenever they are going to book
a hotel room.
Now the question will arise what we can do with this data?
So what type of analysis we can perform on this huge chunk of data?


B.Challenges I resolved using python:
1.reading data
2.Data cleaning(including Removing Duplicated data
3.Performing descriptive analysis.
4.Perform Spatial Analysis.
5.Is any difference between assigned and reserved room types or not ?
6.Bookings by market segment
7.Analysing Avg.price per night (ADR) of various room-types for all the market segment
8.Total guests arrival on each day.
9.Analysing distribution of "guests arrival"
